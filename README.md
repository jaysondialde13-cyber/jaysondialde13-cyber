## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is JAYSON!
Iâ€™m a BSIT student who enjoys programming, biking, and exploring PC technologies. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new skills in coding and system development, with the long-term goal of building impactful projects, starting my own business, and becoming a successful programmer who can one day retire as a millionaire.
